## Erlang implementation of "Game of Life"

## To run:

    $ ./ergol.escript

(You need erlang/escript installed)

    apt-get install erlang

If it passed (Input evolves into Output as expected) it will print nothing and return 0 to the shell.  If it failed it will return 1 and report the result.
